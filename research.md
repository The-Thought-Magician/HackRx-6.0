# LLM Document Processing System Research

## Problem Statement Analysis

The objective is to build a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to process natural language queries and retrieve relevant information from large unstructured documents such as policy documents, contracts, and emails.

### Key Requirements:
- Parse and structure queries to identify key details (age, procedure, location, policy duration)
- Search and retrieve relevant clauses using semantic understanding (not keyword matching)
- Evaluate retrieved information to determine decisions (approval/rejection, payout amounts)
- Return structured JSON responses with justifications mapped to specific clauses
- Handle vague, incomplete, or plain English queries
- Support various document formats (PDFs, Word files, emails)
- Provide explainable AI with clause-level references

### Sample Use Case:
**Input**: "46-year-old male, knee surgery in Pune, 3-month-old insurance policy"
**Output**: Structured JSON with decision, amount, and justification with specific clause references

## Top 3 Approaches for Implementation

### Approach 1: GraphRAG with Knowledge Graph Enhancement

#### Technical Architecture
GraphRAG represents a significant advancement over traditional RAG by constructing knowledge graphs from documents and using graph-based reasoning for complex queries.

**Core Components:**
1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Extract entities (medical procedures, policy terms, conditions) and relationships from documents using LLMs
2. **Multi-level Hierarchical Clustering**: Apply Leiden algorithm for community detection within knowledge graphs
3. **Semantic Community Summaries**: Generate summaries using bottom-up approach for better contextual understanding
4. **Dual Search Strategy**: 
   - Global Search: Leverage community summaries for holistic understanding
   - Local Search: Entity-focused retrieval for specific queries

#### Recent Advances (2024-2025)
- **Microsoft GraphRAG**: Achieved 70-80% win rate over naive RAG on comprehensiveness metrics
- **Enhanced Entity Extraction**: LLM-generated knowledge graphs showing superior performance
- **Community-based Summarization**: Improved contextual understanding across document sections
- **Structured Output Integration**: Better JSON response generation with graph-based justifications

#### Implementation Considerations
```python
# GraphRAG Pipeline Architecture
1. Document Ingestion & Chunking
   - Parse insurance policy documents
   - Extract text, tables, and structured data
   
2. LLM-based Entity/Relationship Extraction
   - Identify: medical procedures, coverage terms, exclusions, conditions
   - Extract relationships: eligibility criteria, coverage limits, waiting periods
   
3. Knowledge Graph Construction
   - Use Neo4j or NetworkX for graph storage
   - Create nodes: entities, clauses, conditions
   - Create edges: relationships, dependencies, exclusions
   
4. Community Detection
   - Apply Leiden algorithm for hierarchical clustering
   - Generate multi-level summaries for each community
   
5. Query Processing
   - Route queries to Global or Local search based on complexity
   - Traverse graph paths for multi-hop reasoning
   
6. Response Generation
   - Map decisions to specific graph paths
   - Generate structured JSON with clause references
```

#### Pros:
- **Superior Multi-hop Reasoning**: Excellent for complex queries requiring understanding across multiple policy sections
- **Relationship Handling**: Naturally handles complex relationships between policy terms, exclusions, and coverage
- **Holistic Understanding**: Community summaries provide better context for comprehensive decisions
- **Explainable Decisions**: Graph traversal paths provide clear justification trails

#### Cons:
- **Higher Computational Cost**: Graph construction and maintenance requires significant resources
- **Complex Setup**: More intricate implementation and maintenance compared to traditional RAG
- **Memory Requirements**: Large knowledge graphs require substantial memory for optimal performance
- **Update Complexity**: Document updates require graph reconstruction or complex incremental updates

#### Best Use Cases:
- Complex insurance policies with intricate interdependencies
- Multi-step eligibility determinations
